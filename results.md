# Distributional Analysis Questions

## Q1: Pooled types

Looking at the results for income quintiles alone (when the types are grouped together), does the tax progressive, proportional, or regressive? How can you tell? What is the difference in ETR between the lowest quintile and highest quintile? Note that it's fine to calculate that with a calculator: you don't need to build it into the script.

* **Answer**: By looking at results for income quintiles alone, I can say that the tax in generally progressive, that is ETR increases as household income grows. 
However, households in 4th quintile are paying higher tax rate than in 5th quintile. I would still say it has more progressive nature. 
The difference between ETR for q1 and q5 is 0.62 = 0.55 = 0.07

## Q2: Pooled incomes

Now look at the results for types alone (when all incomes are grouped together). Do the ETRs differ? If so, say a little about what you see.

* **Answer**: 
1    0.69
2    0.65
3    0.60
4    0.53

ETRs differ. Apprenetly, ETRs are different for households in different regions of the country.

## Q3: Disaggregated results

Now look at the detailed results that are disaggregated by both type and quintile. Within any given type does the tax look progressive, proportional, or regressive? What is the difference between the ETRs of the highest and lowest quintiles for each group?

* **Answer**: In Type 1 tax is fully progressive, difference - 0.19 ; Type 2 - progressive 0.21, 
Type 3 - progressive, difference - 0.21; Type 4 - progressive, difference - 0.25.

## Q4: Conclusion

If an analyst failed to calculate the detailed results and looked only at the ETRs by overall quintile (Q1), would they overstate or understate the policy's progressivity or regressivity? Briefly explain. If possible, also explain why it happens using the insights above.

* **Answer**: They would have underestimated the policy's progressivity. Because the detailed calculations take into
account the type of household, we can see that within each type, the tax is more progressive than when looking at 
general picture
